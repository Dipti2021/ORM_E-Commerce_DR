 ## Introduction 
I have created the backend of an E-Commerce website. MySQL is used as the database and Sequelize packages are used to connect the Express.js API to the database. The SQL database includes tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags. Also, the RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database. Being a back end Code, I have used __Insomnia__ as the API design platform. All the outputs can been tested via the same design.
 In order to run the code, following stepls need to be taken 
  Navigate to the root directory and run 
  ```
npm install
```

 ```
npm install mysql2
```

 ```
npm install express
```

 ```
npm install dotenv

```
  On installing all the necessary libraries, seed the files provide to the My SQL database using the command
   ```
npm run seed

```
Finally ,run the 
   ```
node server 

```
command to run the app
